# How to Run Windows Software on Linux


## Open your Linux terminal and type these commands one-by-one

type 
```bash
sudo apt update
```
and press ↵ Enter. When prompted, enter your password and press ↵ Enter. Then, when prompted, type 
```bash
clear
```
and press ↵ Enter. Now you’re ready to enter the commands to download Wine

## Download Wine
```bash
sudo apt-get install wine 
```
and press ↵ Enter
```bash
sudo apt-get install wine32
```
and press ↵ Enter
```bash
sudo apt-get install libwine
```
and press ↵ Enter

Even though the terminal might look intimidating, don’t worry! You’re unlikely to mess anything up, and all you have to do is copy these commands.

## Navigate to the directory with the file, then open the file with Wine


In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file with the command
```bash
cd <directory name>
```
Then, run the file with the command 
```bash
wine <filename>.exe
```
For instance, if the file example.exe were stored on your desktop, you’d follow this procedure:
```bash
cd Desktop/
```
and press ↵ Enter
```bash
wine example.exe
```
and press ↵ Enter
