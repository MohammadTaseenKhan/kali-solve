# Bluetooth not Working

## Option One

> Open your terminal

type these commands:

```bash
service bluetooth restart
```

## Option two

> Again open your terminal

```bash
sudo service bluetooth restart
```

On systemd systems:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

Then **Reboot**

## Option three

I assumed that mere starting the service didn't get BT to work. While checking it's status it was active (running), but in the above line it printed disabled .

```bash
systemctl enable bluetooth.service
```

```bash
systemctl start bluetooth.service
```

## Final Decision


> Use a dongle or Blutooth Adapter
